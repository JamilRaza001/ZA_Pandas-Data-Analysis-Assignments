I’m excited to share five hands-on projects where I dove deep into data analysis using Pandas, NumPy, 
and Matplotlib. Each project came with unique requirements that challenged me to think critically, clean data, and create insightful visualizations. 
Below is a quick rundown:

Life Expectancy By Country
Learn Statistics with Python
Objective: Investigate the impact of a country’s economic success on its life expectancy.
Highlights:
Loaded and previewed the dataset using Pandas.
Isolated key columns (e.g., life expectancy, GDP) for analysis.
Calculated quartiles with NumPy and visualized distributions with Matplotlib.
Split the dataset into low and high GDP groups to compare life expectancies.


Healthcare in Different States
 Learn Statistics with Python
Objective: Explore hospital charges for medical procedures across various U.S. states.
Highlights:
Filtered data for specific diagnoses (like chest pain).
Used state-level grouping to generate boxplots for cost comparisons.
Analyzed spreads, medians, and outliers to understand regional differences in healthcare pricing.


Page Visits Funnel
 Learn Data Analysis with Pandas
Objective: Analyze website traffic and user behavior for Cool T-Shirts Inc.
Highlights:
Merged multiple DataFrames (visits, cart, checkout, purchase) to build a funnel.
Investigated drop-off rates at each stage, identifying the weakest conversion points.
Calculated average time to purchase, providing insights for conversion rate optimization.


Petal Power Inventory
 Learn Data Analysis with Pandas
Objective: Assist a chain of gardening stores in understanding their inventory.
Highlights:
Processed a comprehensive inventory dataset and segmented data by location.
Extracted product details based on customer requests.
Created new columns to indicate stock status and calculate total product value.
Combined product attributes into a full description for cataloging.


Cleaning US Census Data
 How to Clean Data with Python
Objective: Transform raw census data into clean, analyzable DataFrames.
Highlights:
Used glob and Pandas to load and merge multiple CSV files.
Employed regex and string manipulation to convert data types (e.g., income, gender population).
Handled missing values and duplicates to ensure data integrity.
Visualized data trends through scatterplots and histograms, revealing key demographic insights.
Each project not only honed my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of how data-driven insights can lead to real-world impact. Whether it was through exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, or creating compelling visualizations, these experiences have been invaluable in my journey as a data analyst.
